     <p>
     <h3>CARE OF YOUR POTTERY</h3>
Please hand wash with care. Your pottery is not dishwasher, microwave or oven safe.
We cannot guarantee that your pottery is weatherproof, so if your items are for garden use please place in a sheltered position and do not leave outside during winter.
<br/>PottyRoo’s Ceramics and Crafts cannot take responsibility for how items are handled or used once they have been collected. 
     <h3>FIRING AND COLLECTION</h3>
     
We try our best to ensure your time at PottyRoo’s is enjoyable. The final part of the process involves us glazing and firing your pottery. This is not an exact science and sometimes the kiln can be unpredictable. Whilst we strive for perfection it doesn’t always happen, particularly as these are hand produced crafts. There may be colour variations or minor imperfections which are a result of the hand painted nature of the pottery and the natural state of the clay. Glaze spotting can occur as well as things like pinpricks or kiln brick dust on the items, so please be aware that although we try to control these events from happening, it is not always possible. 
We endeavour to have work fired within 2 weeks, however firing times may vary.

Please leave a contact number (preferably mobile) so that we can let you know as soon as your work is ready for collection.  

We have limited storage space therefore we will keep your work for a maximum of 4 months. If you have not collected within that time, or you do not contact us, you risk the pieces being disposed of.

<h3>POSTAGE</h3>
We are happy to post completed pottery on request. The cost of parcel post by Evri is £4.50 up to 1kg, £6 for 1-2 kg or £8 for over 2kg per parcel which includes postage and packing materials. Other rates available depending on the weight of the parcel. 
Should you wish to have a ‘signed for’ delivery service this will cost an additional £1.00. (Prices subject to change, depending on Evri charges).

Although we pack your items very carefully, Pottyroo’s Ceramics and Crafts cannot take responsibility for items broken or lost in the postal system. We do, however obtain a tracking number and will share this with you.
<h3>FOOD & DRINK</h3>
You are welcome to bring your own drinks but no food in the studio as grease, butter, oils etc from the food can damage the pottery.  

<h3>BREAKAGES</h3>
All breakages must be paid for.
<h3>PAYMENT</h3>
Payment is required at the time of your visit. Card or cash is accepted.
